00:00.240 --> 00:04.800
Electronics is a branch of science and engineering that deals with the study and application

00:05.300 --> 00:08.560
of devices and systems that operate using the flow of electrons.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.360
It involves designing, developing, and manufacturing electronic

00:13.860 --> 00:17.560
circuits and components such as transistors, diodes, and integrated

00:18.060 --> 00:21.440
circuits. Electronics is essential in modern technology,

00:22.080 --> 00:25.800
powering everything from smartphones and computers to medical equipment

00:26.300 --> 00:29.780
and automobiles. It relies on principles of physics and

00:30.280 --> 00:34.220
materials science to create devices that process, transmit, and store

00:34.720 --> 00:37.660
information. The field continuously evolves,

00:37.900 --> 00:41.660
driven by innovations like semiconductors and microprocessors,

00:41.820 --> 00:43.900
shaping industries and daily life.
